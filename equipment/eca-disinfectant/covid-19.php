          Neutral Anolyte ECA Disinfectant
          <!-- &#47; -->&#65295;Steraliser
        </h3>
        <p>
          Neutral Anolyte is very effective against bacteria and viruses including the coronavirus family. It is often used to disinfect drinking water or other water sources. Neutral anolyte can also be used to disinfect/sterilise objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anolyte is a colourless, transparent biocidal liquid, which has a slight smell of chlorine. It consists predominantly of Hypochlorous Acid (HCIO) and Hypochlorite Ion (OCI-) which gives it superior sporicidal and biocidal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Active Chlorine: 2.0-4.0 ppm<br />
            pH 6.5 ± 0.5<br />
            ORP 750-900 mV<br />
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Not for human consumption, is active for a maximum 72 hour and then degrades back into natural water product with neutral pH.
        </p>
        <p>
          Used for environmental disinfection in cleanroom manufacturing facilities and to disinfect/sterilise objects (floors. Roads, outside areas, walls, tools, clothes, foodstuff, etc.). We use ECA technology to produce the disinfectant/steriliser.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECA stands for Electrochemical Activation/ The activation process uses water, salt, electricity, while also producing potent and natural disinfectant/detergent.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How does ECA work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Microbes and bacteria, like other living things need a stable energy supply to survive. ECA destabilises and elevates the electrical charges of the water while also creating an environment in which microbes cannot survive.
        </p>
        <h3>Human Immune System Analogy</h3>
        <p>
          When the human body comes under attack from invading bacteria and viruses, the immune system immediately responds. The body sends increased numbers of specific white blood cells called Neutrophil straight to invasion site. Once activated, these cells produce large amounts of a mixed oxidant solution which is effective in eliminating invading microbes and pathogens. The oxidant produced by the white blood cells’ Hypochlorous Acid (HOCI) is among the most potent natural disinfectants. It is non-toxic to humans and is highly effective as an antimicrobial agent with rapid action.
