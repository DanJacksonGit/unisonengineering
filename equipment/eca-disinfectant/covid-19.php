          ECA Disinfectant for Coronavirus COVID&#8209;19
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unison Engineering have built and provided devices and disinfectants based on Electro Chemical Activation (ECA) Water technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECA Water is very effective against bacteria and viruses including the coronavirus family. It is often used to disinfect drinking water or other water sources. ECA Water can also be used to disinfect and sterilise objects.
        </p>
        <p>
        ECA can change the composition of dissolved gases, acid-base, and redox properties of water within limits less than equivalent chemical regulation (in accordance with the laws of electrolysis). ECA synthesizes from water and dissolved substance chemicals (oxidizing and reducing agents) in the metastable state.
        </p>
        <p>
        ECA is a technology for converting water or dilute solutions of electrolytes into environmentally-friendly antimicrobial disinfectants. It is a colourless, transparent biocidal liquid, which has a slight smell of chlorine. It consists predominantly of Hypochlorous Acid (HCIO) and Hypochlorite Ion (OCI-) which gives it superior sporicidal and biocidal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Active Chlorine: 2.0 - 4.0 ppm<br />
            pH 6.5 ± 0.5<br />
            ORP 750 - 900 mV<br />
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our product is active for a maximum of 48 to 72 hours after being produced and has a neutral pH of 6.5 ± 0.5. The product degrades back into natural water product with neutral pH after this. We can produce disinfectant with an Oxygen Reducing Potential (ORP) of between 750 - 900 mV and Free Available Chlorine (FAC, a bio-degradable chlorine product) up to 500 ppm. For disinfecting, we use diluted FAC to 1.75 ± 0.25 ppm in accordance with EU recommendations. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Patented process at Unison Engineering
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unison engineering have invested in the software, capital equipment, systems, and processes and training to produce ECA. Unison have built a manufacturing plant which uses patent protected process to produce Electro Chemical Activation Water technology (ECA).
        </p>
        <p>
          One of our pilot plants was tested successfully in a New York wastewater treatment plant and is now installed in Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our manufacturing plant in Limerick has the capacity to produce up to 1 million litres of disinfectant per day.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How does ECA work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          ECA stands for Electro Chemical Activation. The activation process uses water, salt and electricity. The process produces potent and natural disinfectant/detergent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microbes and bacteria, like other living things need a stable energy supply to survive. ECA destabilises and elevates the electrical charges of the water while also creating an environment in which microbes cannot survive.
        </p>
        <h3>
          ECA's everyday use
        </h3>
        <p>
          ECA is commonly used for disinfecting drinking water, wastewater, agriculture waste and used as a non-toxic cleaning solution in buildings such as hospitals and similar applications. It is also used for disinfection in cleanroom manufacturing facilities and to disinfect/sterilise objects such as floors, roads, outdoor areas, walls, tools, clothes, foodstuffs and more. We use ECA technology to produce this disinfectant/steriliser.
        </p>
        <p>
          From February the 4th 2020, Wuhan in China began using liquid produced with ECA technology. This ECA liquid was used for spraying streets, buildings, houses and on handled and delivered goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other places where ECA water was used, people were required to walk through a light mist of this electrolytic water to kill any possible surface bacteria.
        </p>
        <h3>
          ECA and COVID&#8209;19
        </h3>
        <p>
          Of the six previously known strains of enveloped viruses, two have been associated with serious outbreaks: SARS and MERS. <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/questions-answers">SARS-CoV-2 is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus</a> (COVID&#8209;19 is the disease associated with this virus). SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 is an enveloped virus and falls into the same group. Disinfectants effective against this group are understood to be effective against SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, when used as directed.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Hypochlorous Acid (HCIO) and the Human Immune System
        </h3>
        <p>
        When the human body comes under attack from invading bacteria and viruses, the immune system immediately responds. The body sends increased numbers of specific white blood cells called neutrophil straight to invasion site. Once activated, these cells produce large amounts of a mixed oxidant solution which is effective in eliminating invading microbes and pathogens. The oxidant produced by the white blood cells; hypochlorous acid (HCIO) is among one of the most potent natural disinfectants. It is non-toxic to humans and is highly effective as an antimicrobial agent with rapid action.
