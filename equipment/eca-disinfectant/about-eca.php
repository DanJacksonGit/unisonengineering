          Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
          A few years ago, we began work on designing an automated production unit that uses non-toxic liquid for water disinfection. This piece of equipment was designed to be capable of increasing and decreasing pH as well as controlling odours.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of research and development, our product is now a <a href="./validation.php">validified</a> and proven concept. The resulting product is Electrochemically Activated (ECA) Disinfectant. This product is kind to the environment and eliminates the necessity for transporting and storing dangerous chemicals. ECA Process Water lowers costs, reduces carbon emissions and eliminates some risks by letting you maintain control of production. ECA Disinfectant doesn't require specialist equipment or maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system typically uses what would otherwise be waste process water and electrochemically activates it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Definitions of electrochemical activation
        </h3>
        <p>
          Electrochemical activation is a technology to generate metastable
          substances with strong oxidizing and reducing properties and its subsequent use
          in various technological processes instead of chemically stable reagents.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a physical-chemical process, electrochemical activation is a
          combination of electro-chemical and electro-physical effects on water with ions
          and molecules of dissolved substances carried out in conditions of minimum heat
          in the space charge region at a surface of an electrode (either anode or
          cathode) of an electrochemical system under non-equilibrium charge transfer
          across the border of &quot;electrode-electrolyte&quot; electrons.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Efficiency
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Capacity of solutions and gases used for disinfection, washing, extraction,
            oxidation and in many technological processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Closest to maximum
            theoretically possible rate of salt conversion from initial water or a mineralised solution, which can be released exclusively by electrochemical reactors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          ECA is Environmentally Sustainable
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using salt solutions which contain alkali and alkali-earth metals and mixing them with water using electicity results in pure, low-mineralized ECA solutions. Low-mineralized ECA solutions that with time self-degrade to its primal products without formation of harmful and toxic by-products
        </p>
        <p>
          Zero toxicity compared to other
          ECA solutions but it’s similarity of active compounds produced by macro
          organisms during phagocytosis.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Cost efficiency
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use of affordable and inexpensive reagents – salt and water – in electrolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Energy-saving performance of Unison ECA devices as compared to other electrolysis devices, whereby technical parameters of device operation are maximally close to theoretically possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unison ECA devices generate reagents at place of use in any quantity so there is no need to deliver, store
          and securely maintain standard reagents. By not using standard reagents Unison ECA devices are explosion safe.

            Unlike existing disinfection technologies, which require dedicated infrastructure capital expenditure, the Unison ECA unit can be deployable virtually anywhere without supporting infrastructure. No concrete. No steel. It doesn’t need dedicated budgets or complex financing bonds. It can be leased or purchased directly and operated for a fraction of the cost of other technologies.
          </p>

        <h3>
          Case Study: Hudson Valley WWTP
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Unison ECA unit was first deployed in coordination with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. It was piloted at a large municipally owned Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) on the Hudson River.
        </p>
        <p>
          New York has some of the most stringent wastewater discharge permit standards in the world, but The Hydro flux easily met permit standards and delivered demonstrable cost savings. The facility uses a sodium hypochlorite disinfection system comprising of two 5,000 US gallon (~18,927L) storage tanks in its basement. Permits samples are collected daily and cannot contain more than 200 colonies of fecal coliform (a disinfection efficacy indicator), nor have a chlorine residual (byproduct) in excess of 0.75mg/l. In order to meet its permit standard, the facility uses approximately 10,000 US gallons (~37854L) of sodium hypochlorite every two weeks, as well as sodium bisulfite to dechlorinate discharge water in order to meet chlorine residual thresholds.
        </p>
